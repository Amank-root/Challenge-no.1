## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

While doing this project I had my recap and practice of basic ```HTML``` && ```Css```.



### Continued development

I would like to focus on my ```JavaScript``` because learning is endless.


### Useful resources

- In this Project no external resource needed but I would recommand to use: 

- [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - If beginner that you can learn ```js``` on behalf of ```css``` and be more productive. This does not mean you don't have to learn css. Css is must.
- [TailBlock](https://tailblocks.cc/) - Another Css Framework. Alternative of ```BootStrap```
